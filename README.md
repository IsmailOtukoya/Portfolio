### Fraud Detection model Using Ensemble method

[Publication](https://medium.com/@otukoyaismail/a-project-walkthrough-into-a-fraud-detection-model-05ee93c55e30)

This project implements a fraud detection model to identify and address fraudulent activities in financial transactions. The model employs a combination of traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques, forming an ensemble to harness the strengths of individual models.

Models Included Logistic Regression: A simple yet interpretable linear model providing a baseline for comparison.

Random Forest: A robust ensemble method of decision trees, excelling in capturing complex relationships.

XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm known for its predictive accuracy and ability to handle non-linear patterns.

Neural Network: A deep learning model designed to learn intricate patterns and enhance fraud detection
